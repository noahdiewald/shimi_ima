This is the root directory to a couchapp[1].

This couch app handles all the code that runs on the database itself. It
can be used as a model for creating other applications that use the
language data you have collected in Æ©imi Ima.

The management of this code is performed with a couchapp tool, like
erica[2].

Note that this code is not run in the web browser but on CouchDB.
